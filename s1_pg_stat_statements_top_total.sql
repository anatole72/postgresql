--Slowest Queries, by Total Time (requires pg_stat_statements extension)

-- In pg_stat_statements, there is a problem: sometimes (quite often), it registers the same query twice (or even more).
-- It's easy to check in your DB:
--
--   with heh as (
--     select userid, dbid, query, count(*), array_agg(queryid) queryids
--     from pg_stat_statements group by 1, 2, 3 having count(*) > 1
--  ) select left(query, 85) || '...', userid, dbid, count, queryids from heh;
--
-- This query gives you "full picture", aggregating stats for each query-database-username ternary

-- Works with Postgres 9.6

select
  sum(calls) as calls,
  sum(total_time) as total_time,
  sum(mean_time * calls) / sum(calls) as mean_time,
  max(max_time) as max_time,
  min(min_time) as min_time,
